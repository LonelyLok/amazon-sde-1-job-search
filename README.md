## Amazon SDE 1 Jobs

simple web app that show all US amazon software engineer job that have less than 1 year experience (SDE 1)

I built this because sometimes the yeah of experince filter on https://www.amazon.jobs/en/search is missing (I think it is something that do with the cookies)

I interviewed with Amazon for SDE2 but I failed and got down level to SDE1.

Amazon don't really have a lot of SDE1 open in my area and my interview result only valid for 12 months so I need to check this everyday and hopefully snipe some job xd.

The reality is that very likely I will not find a SDE1 position in my area in the next 12 months but I like copium.
